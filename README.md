# COE528_Object-Oriented-Eng-Analysis-and-Design

This repository is made with the intension to assist individuals with problems and concepts associated COE318 and should not be taken directly for lab.

Contains Java code and UML diagrams for Labs 1-4

Lab 5 contain HTML files for UML diagrams of Use Case, Class and Sequence Diagrams.

All Tasks relate to the given situation:
A Vehicle dealership sells and buys used vehicles. The dealership’s listing management system stores information about the dealership’s vehicles (either Car or Truck) as well as their listing information. A Vehicle has the following information: vehicle identification number (vid), company, model, exterior colour, year of production, transition (automatic or not). Furthermore, for a Car, the number of seats it has, and for a Truck the maximum load it can support are captured separately. Each Listing has a listingId and a Listing must consist of one vehicle. Each vehicle can be listed in 0 to more listings. A record for a Vehicle which is not associated with any listings can be maintained as well. Each Listing has the following information: price, listing date, mileage (at the time of listing), and status (sold, active). A Vehicle may either be sold or bought from the dealership. In case of selling a Vehicle, a dealership manager handles the request. In case of buying a vehicle, a sales representative handles the request for which he/she will search in the active listings and will also check previous listings to see whether the Vehicle has been sold by the dealership before and if so, retrieves the sold Listing(s).

Task 1 requlres a Use case diagram.
Task 2 requires a Class diagram.
Task 3 - 5 requires a sequence diagram for: Get historical vehicle listings method, Searching active listings method, and Buying a vehicle.
